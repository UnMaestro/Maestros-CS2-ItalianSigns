# Italian Signs WE-Module for Cities: Skylines II  
## EARLY ACCESS

Ciao and Hello!  
This is a **Write Everywhere module** that brings a collection of **Italian road and traffic signs** into your game.  
After the creation of the German Signs pack, I’ve was already working on the Italian Sign's. But because of the sudden release of the Dutch Creator Pack I've made the decision to focus on the dutch sign's first. But now I can proudly bring Italy’s beautiful sign system to life!

Currently, this is still an **Early Access version**, focusing mainly on **Traffic Signs** and **Autostrada/Expressway Signs** (including start/end markers, tunnels, and bridges). Like the Dutch Sign's.
There are already **over 30 layouts** and around **200 images** of authentic signs.  

Future updates will add **more arrows**, **more highway layouts**, and **blue, white, yellow, and brown background signs**, covering every road type in Italy.

###  Fonts

This mod uses the road signage typeface **Traffic Type Spain**. I tried searching for the original Font for Italian sign's, but it seems the goverment have this Font on private.
For copyright reasons, the font is **not included** and must be installed manually.

##### You can find it [here](https://www.onlinewebfonts.com/download/f820971323ed634d5ef50513e34fbd3c)

#### How to install the font
1. Download the **Traffic Type Spain** font file (`.ttf`).  
2. Go to your local Cities: Skylines II mods folder:  
   `\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\Klyte45Mods\WriteEverywhere\fonts`  
   *(if the `fonts` folder doesn’t exist, create it manually)*  
3. Place the `.ttf` file inside this folder.  
4. Start the game and load your city.  
5. Open **City Fonts** (click the “W” icon on the top-left).  
6. Press `+` and select your downloaded font.

##  Troubleshooting
- If you get the Error on startup **.... Should not be empty.**: 
    - You could ignore it or resubscribe to the mod. This happens when I delete a atlas folder, Skyve or PDXMods dont delete that for some reason.
