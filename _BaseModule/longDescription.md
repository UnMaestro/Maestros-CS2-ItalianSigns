###  Fonts

This mod uses the road signage typeface **Traffic Type Spain**. I tried searching for the original Font for Italian sign's, but it seems the goverment have this Font on private.
For copyright reasons, the font is **not included** and must be installed manually.

#### You can find it [here](https://www.onlinewebfonts.com/download/f820971323ed634d5ef50513e34fbd3c)

### How to install the font
1. Download the **Traffic Type Spain** font file (`.ttf`).  
2. Go to your local Cities: Skylines II mods folder:  
   `\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\.Klyte45Mods\WriteEverywhere\fonts`  
   *(if the `fonts` folder doesn’t exist, create it manually)*  
3. Place the `.ttf` file inside this folder.  
4. Start the game and load your city.  
5. Open **City Fonts** (click the “W” icon on the top-left).  
6. Press `+` and select your downloaded font.

##  Troubleshooting
- If you get the Error on startup **.... Should not be empty.**: 
    - You could ignore it or resubscribe to the mod. This happens when I delete a atlas folder, Skyve or PDXMods dont delete that for some reason.
